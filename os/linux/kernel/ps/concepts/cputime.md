# CPU 时间

## 数据结构

```c
/**
 * struct task_cputime - collected CPU time counts
 * @utime:		time spent in user mode, in nanoseconds
 * @stime:		time spent in kernel mode, in nanoseconds
 * @sum_exec_runtime:	total time spent on the CPU, in nanoseconds
 *
 * This structure groups together three kinds of CPU time that are tracked for
 * threads and thread groups.  Most things considering CPU time want to group
 * these counts together and treat all three of them in parallel.
 */
struct task_cputime {
	u64				utime;
	u64				stime;
	unsigned long long		sum_exec_runtime;
};
