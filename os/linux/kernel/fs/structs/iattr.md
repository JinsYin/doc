```c
/*
 * <include/linux/fs.h>
 *
 * This is the Inode Attributes structure, used for notify_change().  It
 * uses the above definitions as flags, to know which values have changed.
 * Also, in this manner, a Filesystem can look at only the values it cares
 * about.  Basically, these are the attributes that the VFS layer can
 * request to change from the FS layer.
