```c
/*
 * <include/linux/fs.h>
 *
 * struct address_space - Contents of a cacheable, mappable object.
 * @host: Owner, either the inode or the block_device.
 * @i_pages: Cached pages.
 * @gfp_mask: Memory allocation flags to use for allocating pages.
 * @i_mmap_writable: Number of VM_SHARED mappings.
 * @i_mmap: Tree of private and shared mappings.
 * @i_mmap_rwsem: Protects @i_mmap and @i_mmap_writable.
 * @nrpages: Number of page entries, protected by the i_pages lock.
 * @nrexceptional: Shadow or DAX entries, protected by the i_pages lock.
 * @writeback_index: Writeback starts here.
 * @a_ops: Methods.
 * @flags: Error bits and flags (AS_*).
 * @wb_err: The most recent error which has occurred.
 * @private_lock: For use by the owner of the address_space.
 * @private_list: For use by the owner of the address_space.
 * @private_data: For use by the owner of the address_space.
